Just a stupid meme extention. 
When started every 10 sec a random meme from r/memes window opens
 

add it in chrome:
1. navigate to chrome://extensions
2. at the right top you can click develeper mode
3. extract the zip
4. click on the folder and when no other folders are visible click on select folder
5. if you downloaded from the releases tab you get a error, noting te scary you are already done :)
6. CLICK ON START

It is not perfect afcoure, if you want to make it better you can afcourse do that. I made this in one day i just think it whas funny it is not very serious!!!!
