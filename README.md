Just a stupid meme extention. 
When started every 10 sec a random meme from r/memes window opens
 

add it in chrome:(chromium so edge, Vivaldi, ect will word but you need to navigate to edge://extensions or something. most browsers are chromium exept for firefox based)
1. navigate to chrome://extensions
2. at the right top you can click develeper mode
3. extract the zip
4. click on the folder and when no other folders are visible click on select folder(when you clicked on add extension in chrome)
5. if you downloaded from the releases tab you get a error, noting to scary you are already done :)
6. CLICK ON START

It is not perfect afcoure, if you want to make it better you can afcourse do that. I made this in one day i just think it whas funny it is not very serious! And chrome will probably say that it is a security risk, because you didn't download from the extension store.
